[94mOkay, I found the recipe for beef wellington.
        Here are all the steps:
        Put the mushrooms into a food processor with some seasoning and pulse to a rough paste
Scrape the paste into a pan and cook over a high heat for about 10 mins, tossing frequently, to cook out the moisture from the mushrooms
Spread out on a plate to cool
Heat in a frying pan and add a little olive oil
Season the beef and sear in the hot pan for 30 secs only on each side
(You don't want to cook it at this stage, just colour it)
Remove the beef from the pan and leave to cool, then brush all over with the mustard
Lay a sheet of cling film on a work surface and arrange the Parma ham slices on it, in slightly overlapping rows
With a palette knife, spread the mushroom paste over the ham, then place the seared beef fillet in the middle
Keeping a tight hold of the cling film from the edge, neatly roll the Parma ham and mushrooms around the beef to form a tight barrel shape
Twist the ends of the cling film to secure
Chill for 15-20 mins to allow the beef to set and keep its shape
Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a large rectangle, the thickness of a Â£1 coin
Remove the cling film from the beef, then lay in the centre
Brush the surrounding pastry with egg yolk
Fold the ends over, the wrap the pastry around the beef, cutting off any excess
Turn over, so the seam is underneath, and place on a baking sheet
Brush over all the pastry with egg and chill for about 15 mins to let the pastry rest
Heat the oven to 200C, 400F, gas 6
Lightly score the pastry at 1cm intervals and glaze again with beaten egg yolk
Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 180C, 350F, gas 4 and cook for another 15 mins
Allow to rest for 10-15 mins before slicing and serving with the side dishes of your choice
The beef should still be pink in the centre when you serve it[0m

	This would take about 15 minutes
	Slowly sautÃ©ing the chicken will enhance the flavor, so do not expedite this step by putting it on high heat
	When the oil separates from the spices, add the beaten yogurt keeping the heat on lowest so that the yogurt doesnât split
	Sprinkle the remaining coriander seeds and add half of the dried fenugreek leaves
