[94m	Put the mushrooms into a food processor with some seasoning and pulse to a rough paste
	Scrape the paste into a pan and cook over a high heat for about 10 mins, tossing frequently, to cook out the moisture from the mushrooms
	Spread out on a plate to cool
	Heat in a frying pan and add a little olive oil
	Season the beef and sear in the hot pan for 30 secs only on each side
	(You don't want to cook it at this stage, just colour it)
	Remove the beef from the pan and leave to cool, then brush all over with the mustard
	Lay a sheet of cling film on a work surface and arrange the Parma ham slices on it, in slightly overlapping rows
	With a palette knife, spread the mushroom paste over the ham, then place the seared beef fillet in the middle
	Keeping a tight hold of the cling film from the edge, neatly roll the Parma ham and mushrooms around the beef to form a tight barrel shape
	Twist the ends of the cling film to secure
	Chill for 15-20 mins to allow the beef to set and keep its shape
	Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a large rectangle, the thickness of a Â£1 coin
	Remove the cling film from the beef, then lay in the centre
	Brush the surrounding pastry with egg yolk
	Fold the ends over, the wrap the pastry around the beef, cutting off any excess
	Turn over, so the seam is underneath, and place on a baking sheet
	Brush over all the pastry with egg and chill for about 15 mins to let the pastry rest
	Heat the oven to 200C, 400F, gas 6
	Lightly score the pastry at 1cm intervals and glaze again with beaten egg yolk
	Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 180C, 350F, gas 4 and cook for another 15 mins
	Allow to rest for 10-15 mins before slicing and serving with the side dishes of your choice
	The beef should still be pink in the centre when you serve it[0m

[94m	1 Preheat the oven to 230Â°C
	
2 Add the sugar and crumble the fresh yeast into warm water
	
3 Allow the mixture to stand for 10 â€“ 15 minutes in a warm place (we find a windowsill on a sunny day works best) until froth develops on the surface
	
4 Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl, make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil
	
5 Lightly flour your hands, and slowly mix the ingredients together until they bind
	
6 Generously dust your surface with flour
	
7 Throw down the dough and begin kneading for 10 minutes until smooth, silky and soft
	
8 Place in a lightly oiled, non-stick baking tray (we use a round one, but any shape will do!)

9 Spread the passata on top making sure you go to the edge
	
10 Evenly place the mozzarella (or other cheese) on top, season with the oregano and black pepper, then drizzle with a little olive oil
	
11 Cook in the oven for 10 â€“ 12 minutes until the cheese slightly colours
	
12 When ready, place the basil leaf on top and tuck in![0m
